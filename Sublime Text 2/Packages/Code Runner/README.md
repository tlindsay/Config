A simple plugin to use the current file as source code, run it and show the result.
It is just like the Mac App `CodeRunner`, but with less feature.

## currently supported command :
   -  `run_code`
   -  `run_code_custom`

## you can bind your key to the command like this :
   `{ "keys" : ["ctrl+r"], "command": "run_code" }`
